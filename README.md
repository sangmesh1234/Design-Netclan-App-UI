# Design-Netclan-App-UI
 develop an interactive web application using Python and Vue.JS that allows users to upload videos, add custom subtitles text and view these subtitles in sync with the video.
Part 1 - Front-end (Vue.js):


Setup Vue.js Project:

Set up a new Vue.js project using Vue CLI or your preferred method.

Create UI Components:

Design the UI components for video upload, subtitle input, video playback, and subtitle synchronization.

Video Upload:

Implement video upload using an HTML file input. Use Vue to handle the file upload event.
<input type="file" @change="handleFileUpload" />

Subtitle Input:

Create a form for users to input subtitles and associate them with timestamps. Use Vue data to store subtitle data.

vue

<textarea v-model="newSubtitle.text"></textarea>
<input type="time" v-model="newSubtitle.timestamp" />
<button @click="addSubtitle">Add Subtitle</button>
Video Playback and Subtitle Sync:

Integrate a video player library like Video.js. Display subtitles below the video player and update their display based on the video's current time.

vue

<video ref="videoPlayer" controls @timeupdate="syncSubtitles">
  <track v-for="subtitle in subtitles" :src="subtitle.src" :kind="subtitle.kind" />
</video>
Part 2 - Video API (Flask as an example):

Set Up Flask:

Create a Flask application and set up routes for API endpoints.

Video Upload API:

Create an API endpoint that receives the uploaded video file and saves it on the server using Flask's request.files.

Subtitle API:

Implement API endpoints to create and retrieve subtitles associated with the video. Store subtitle data in a database or file.

python
@app.route('/api/subtitles', methods=['POST'])
def create_subtitle():
    data = request.json
    # Store subtitle data and associate it with the video

@app.route('/api/subtitles/<video_id>', methods=['GET'])
def get_subtitles(video_id):
    # Retrieve subtitles associated with the video
Part 3 - Creativity/Innovation:

Implement a unique feature, such as real-time collaboration for subtitle editing:

Real-time Collaboration:

Integrate a real-time collaboration library like Firebase or Pusher to allow multiple users to edit subtitles simultaneously. Update subtitles in real-time across all connected clients.

Deliverables:

Deployed Application:

Deploy your application on a service like Heroku, Netlify, or Vercel. Provide the URL for evaluation.
